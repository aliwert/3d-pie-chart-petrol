- This repository contains the code to generate a 3D pie chart representing petrol production in various countries. The chart is created using the AmCharts library.

## Introduction
- This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive 3D pie chart using the AmCharts library. The chart visualizes the consumption of petrol in different countries. Each slice of the pie represents the petrol consumption in a specific country, and the size of the slice is proportional to the amount of petrol consumed.

## Usage
- To use this code, include the necessary AmCharts library files in your HTML file. Then, copy the provided HTML and JavaScript code into your HTML file. Customize the data as needed by modifying the chart.data array. Adjust chart settings, such as inner radius and depth, according to your preferences. Finally, run your HTML file in a web browser to see the generated pie chart.
